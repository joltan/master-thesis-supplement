# Supplementary Materials: Conceptualizing the Business Models of Machine Learning as a Service Platforms

This document contains supplementary materials supporting the MSc Thesis "Conceptualizing the Business Models of Machine Learning as a Service Platforms."

## Overview

This supplementary document provides detailed methodological documentation and empirical evidence supporting the development of a comprehensive business model taxonomy for MLaaS platforms. The materials follow Nickerson et al.'s (2013) iterative taxonomy development methodology, documenting the systematic progression from conceptual refinement through empirical validation.

## Document Structure

### 1. Data Sources (Pages 2-9)
Comprehensive documentation of all data sources used in the taxonomy development process, including:
- Primary platform documentation and technical specifications
- Third-party analysis reports and industry publications
- Academic literature and theoretical frameworks
- Validation sources for case classification

### 2. Case Codebooks (Pages 10-49)

#### 2.1 Evaluation of Conceptual-to-Empirical Iterations (C2E-1, C2E-2, C2E-3) (Pages 10-14)
Detailed evaluation steps to validate the preliminary business model taxonomy at the end of conceptual-to-empirical phase. 

#### 2.2 First Empirical-to-Conceptual Iteration (E2C-1) (Pages 15-21)
Detailed coding of MLaaS platform cases during the first empirical iteration. 

#### 2.3 Second Empirical-to-Conceptual Iteration (E2C-2) (Pages 22-27)
Second round empirical analysis featuring:
- Refined case coding with updated taxonomy structure
- Resolution of classification ambiguities from E2C-1
- Further dimension adjustments based on additional empirical cases

#### 2.4 Third Empirical-to-Conceptual Iteration (E2C-3) (Pages 28-34)
Final empirical-to-conceptual iteration documenting:
- Stabilized taxonomy structure with comprehensive case coverage
- Resolution of remaining classification challenges
- Validation of taxonomy completeness and mutual exclusivity

#### 2.5 Taxonomy Evaluation (Pages 35-41)
Systematic evaluation of the final taxonomy using established criteria:
- Structural validity assessment following Szopinski et al. (2020) guidelines
- Practical usability evaluation using Miles and Huberman (1994) criteria
- Application testing with representative MLaaS platform cases

#### 2.6 Taxonomy Analysis (Pages 42-49)
Cross-case analysis and archetype derivation:
- Pattern identification across all 24 analyzed cases
- Clustering analysis leading to four distinct business model archetypes
- Archetype characterization and validation

## Methodology

The supplementary materials follow the systematic taxonomy development approach proposed by Nickerson et al. (2013), alternating between conceptual-to-empirical (C2E) and empirical-to-conceptual (E2C) iterations until theoretical saturation is achieved. 

## Usage

These materials support the reproducibility and transparency of the research by providing:
- Complete audit trail of taxonomy development decisions
- Detailed case coding for verification purposes
- Methodological documentation for future research extensions
- Empirical foundation for the derived business model archetypes
